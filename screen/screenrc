#
# See screenrc-20040815 for the old version, which included the global screenrc
# example which is distributed with screen.

# The statusbar's features include:
#  o host name at the left end (bold if active split region)
#  o date and time (mm-dd HH:MM) at the right end (bold if active split region)
#  o window numbers, status chars and names in the middle;
#    if there's not enough space, the list is abbreviated at the left and/or
#    right end in such a way that the host name, date/time and current window
#    are always visible;
#    the current window is displayed in bold
#  o if a hardstatus is set (dynamically), it is displayed in red just after
#    the host name; to get rid of it (e.g., after exiting elinks), use this
#    to set the hardstatus to empty:
#
#      echo -e '\e]2;\a'
# 

# set colors to light gray on light blue
